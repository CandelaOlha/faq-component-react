# ‚ùì FAQ Component

In order to maintain my daily programming practice, I chose to develop the FAQ component considering that it's one of the most common front-end patterns.

## How to start

To view the files and visit the website you must run the following commands in your console:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## How it works

Users should be able to:

- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## Technologies

- React JS

## What comes next

I'm still figuring out how to add a transition so that the question block expands slowly.
